# mirrorlog.conf.yml
# Configuration file for MirrorLog

# Please note that the YAML parser is very small and has some limitations:
#   1- Lists must be in multiple-line form, and can only contain values.
#     This will work:
#       MyList:
#       - MyValue
#     This will NOT work:
#       MyList:
#       - MyElement: MyValue
#   2- Values must be a single line, spanning & folding are not recognized.
#   However, escape characters will be preserved, so you can make newlines this way.
#     This will work:
#       MyElement: "My\nValue"
#     This will NOT work:
#       MyElement1: |
#         My
#         Value
#   3- Comments must be on their own line.
#     This will work:
#       # This is what MyElement does.
#       MyElement:
#     This will NOT work:
#       MyElement: # This is what MyElement does.

# Configuration for the log server itself
server:
  # How many connections should the server be able to simultaneously handle?
  # Having a lot of threads will slightly increase resource usage, but
  # having too few threads will cause connections to be rejected.
  # -- Example --
  # threads: 32
  threads: 32

  # Which port should the server listen on? (integer)
  # This can be overridden by passing a different port
  # as an argument when starting the software.
  # -- Example --
  # port: 1234
  port: 4357

  # How long should the server wait before disconnecting inactive clients? (integer)
  # This duration is measured in milliseconds. (15 min is 900000 ms)
  # Note that if a client disconnects or a socket error occurs, the connection
  # will be automatically terminated, so this only handles inactive clients.
  timeout: 1800000

  # Should the server ignore requests from unknown addresses? (true/false)
  # -- Example --
  # restricted: true
  restricted: true

  # If 'restricted' is true, which addresses should we allow connections from? (list)
  # -- Example --
  # allowed_addresses:
  #   - 127.0.0.1
  allowed_addresses:
    - 127.0.0.1

# Configuration for log output
output:
  # What length should component names be padded up to? (integer)
  # This makes the log more readable, provided most component names are under this length.
  # -- Example --
  # component_pad: 24
  component_pad: 24

  # Should the server log to files as well as the console? (true/false)
  # -- Example --
  # log_to_file: true
  log_to_file: true

  # How often (in hours) should the server create a new log file? (integer)
  # -- Example --
  # file_duration: 24
  file_duration: 24

  # How many old log files should the server retain? (integer)
  # -- Example --
  # file_history: 10
  file_history: 10

# That's it! You're done setting up MirrorLog.
